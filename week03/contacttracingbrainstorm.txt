Our school will NOT be using contact tracing apps.

1. we feel our school can more adequately and effectively trace student contacts through their schedule
- "contact" is describe as being within 6 feet of another person for longer than 10 minutes which excludes hallway time
- apps/location can be spoofed or disabled and will provide a false sense of confidence in their capability to track contacts

2. not everyone has a phone
- this raises both issues of relying too heavily on technology to trace contacts above manual tracing, which in this case we feel has less room for error
- equity issue; not eveyrone has a phone means not everyone will get same level of tracing

3. legally indefensible
- places where similar "required app" cases have gone to court consistently rule in employees favor
- employers often drop the case before it goes to court because they cannot win / legally indefensible
