# PLANE SEATING ASSIGNMENT 
## Brainstorming Ethical Modifications

*After discussing this at length with my first and 2nd group and eventually with partners for this assignment, we agreed on the following:*

- allow for parties of 2 max to request to sit together with proof of
  - assistance needed due to health reasons or impairment
  - a child in need of accompaniment by relative/guardian
    - **REASONING:** Allow parents to supervise child and an individual to receive necessary assistance; this is for obvious ethical and safety reasons
>
- no option for economy plus seating
    - **REASONING:** With steady demand and the dynamics involved with changing fares alone, the industry is making quite the profit already; removing economy plus options, as it was in the past, can prevent unethical situations and does not create an unethical circumstance, assuming that accommodations are already considered   
>
- bulkhead seats blocked out/reserved for those with accomodations up until 2 days before flight
  - **REASONING:** US Dept of Transportation requires blcoking out certain seats for accommodating for service animals or fused legs; should also reserve for those who submit proof of conditions that need this physical accommodation
>
- optional: give preference for window seating at an extra price by moving an already assigned seat on the left side over one and already assigned seat on the right side back one (blocked out accommodation seats such as verified pairs and bulkhead seats excluded); to make it more manageable, if there is no case where there is an available seat after one move, then this preference is rendered unavailable
    - **REASONING:** although it isn't an official medical condition, a group member pointed out that in their frequent flyer days, he encountered many who clearly needed a window seat to prevent excessive vomitting; this is an opportunity to cater to the company with an opportunity for profit while still not throwing off the policies put in place to aim for equity
