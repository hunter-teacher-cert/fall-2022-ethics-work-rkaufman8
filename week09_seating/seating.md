### First Priority: special needs passengers and their party
**Determine how many passengers in group**
* if <= 2, assign block of 2 together regardless

* else if > 2, how many require special boarding or seat location?
    * if > 1 special case, **more than one companion passenger?**

      **yes:** split special cases evenly by companion, allow sub groups to sit together for additional money (even though I think they should be allowed to block together for no fee)

      **no:** all special cases sit together with companion


**Allow choice of exit row or other accommodation.**

        **yes:** split under 13s evenly by number of 18s+, allow sub groups to sit together for additional money (even though I think they should be allowed to block together for no fee)
